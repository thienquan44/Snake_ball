The Prey That Runs
Game Description
"The Prey That Runs" is a classic Snake game with a twist! Instead of just eating static food, you, as the snake, must chase a smart and agile red ball that actively tries to escape. The arena shrinks as you play, making survival increasingly challenging.

‚ú® Special Features

Prey: The red ball isn't just sitting there! It will try to run away when you get close. It even has a special one-time "long sprint" to a far corner if you chase it for too long.

Shrinking Arena: The game board gets smaller each time you catch the prey, increasing the difficulty as you progress.

Unlimited Sprint Boost: Use the spacebar to give your snake a temporary burst of speed to catch the elusive prey.
